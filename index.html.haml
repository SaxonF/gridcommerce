				%blockquote A combination of events which are not individually beneficial, but occurring together produce a good or wonderful outcome.
				%p In the process one thing seems to have been lost in translation from his original observation, that I think still stands true. And that’s that sagacity was involved—a word that has roots in seeking, being observant, wise and keen.
